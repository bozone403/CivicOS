üî¨ 1. Campaign Finance & Lobbyist Influence Mapping
Missing:

Real-time or historical tracking of political donations, corporate lobbying activity, and PAC influence at both federal and provincial levels

What to Add:

Donation transparency dashboards (pulling from Elections Canada, Lobbyist Registry)

‚ÄúFollow the Money‚Äù visualizations: track who funds whom, with links to votes/bills

AI-powered alerts when funding patterns correlate with policy shifts or contracts

Why It Matters:
This is the black box of Canadian politics. Cracking it open creates unparalleled transparency into how power actually moves.

üßæ 2. Government Contract & Procurement Tracker
Missing:

No module for tracking which companies win government bids, who approved them, and the value of the contracts

What to Add:

Scrape federal/provincial procurement databases (MERX, Buyandsell.gc.ca)

Public contract database sorted by agency, contractor, value, and project

Conflict-of-interest detection (e.g. donations from awarded firms)

Why It Matters:
Massive waste, fraud, and insider contracting happens here ‚Äî and it‚Äôs almost completely invisible to the public. This closes the loop on where the money goes after bills pass.

üìÇ 3. Bureaucratic Oversight Layer (Public Sector Accountability)
Missing:

No insight into unelected decision-makers (deputy ministers, health officers, regulatory agencies)

What to Add:

Profiles of high-level bureaucrats, agency heads, and public health officers

Decision logs and directives they‚Äôve issued (e.g. emergency orders, health mandates)

AI summary of bureaucratic vs. political power conflicts

Why It Matters:
Canada runs on bureaucratic power more than most citizens realize. This layer allows CivicOS to show who is actually making decisions behind elected officials.

üß≠ 4. Policy Simulation & Counterproposal Engine
Missing:

Users cannot model alternative laws or simulate how bills would affect outcomes differently

What to Add:

Interactive ‚ÄúPolicy Sandbox‚Äù where users can edit or propose a version of a bill

AI simulates economic, legal, and social impacts

Community voting + version control for alternative legislation

Why It Matters:
It makes CivicOS not just reactive, but proactively legislative ‚Äî turning it into a citizen legislature simulator. Could even create a people‚Äôs legislative pipeline.

üß† 5. AI Political Memory + Timeline Forensic Tools
Missing:

No forensic memory or audit trail of past policy moves, narratives, or reversals

What to Add:

Full temporal political memory ‚Äî every major statement, policy change, vote, and contradiction tracked by person/party/issue

AI-powered timeline comparisons (e.g., ‚ÄúHow did their climate policy evolve from 2015‚Äì2025?‚Äù)

Why It Matters:
Gives citizens institutional memory. It erodes amnesia-based propaganda by tying political statements to real outcomes over time.

üì° 6. Whistleblower & Leak Aggregator
Missing:

No platform integration for receiving or displaying government leaks or whistleblower reports

What to Add:

Anonymous submission portals (via SecureDrop-like architecture)

Curated section of verified leaks or FOI (Freedom of Information) releases

AI contextualizer to explain documents in simple terms

Why It Matters:
This turns CivicOS into the Canadian version of WikiLeaks + ProPublica ‚Äî increasing pressure on institutions to remain clean.

‚öñÔ∏è 7. Legal Case Tracker: Constitutional Challenges & Precedents
Missing:

No visibility into how laws are being challenged in courts or what legal precedents are active

What to Add:

Track constitutional/legal challenges to bills

Database of legal precedents with case summaries

AI-explained legal relevance per policy (e.g., ‚ÄúThis bill conflicts with 1986 ruling XYZ‚Äù)

Why It Matters:
This allows users to track the real consequences of legislation and legal activism, closing the civic loop between Parliament and courts.
