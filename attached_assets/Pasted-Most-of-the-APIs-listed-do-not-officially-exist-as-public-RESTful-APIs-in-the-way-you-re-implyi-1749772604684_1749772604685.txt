Most of the **APIs listed do not officially exist** as public, RESTful APIs in the way you're implying — at least not all in a standardized or fully documented way. Some **exist partially**, others **are web portals that require scraping**, and a few **have unofficial or limited endpoints**.

Here’s a breakdown of **what’s real**, **what’s partial**, and **what’s conceptual**:

---

### ✅ **APIs That Exist (Confirmed & Public):**

#### **1. Parliament of Canada Open Data**

* ✅ Exists: [https://www.ourcommons.ca/en/open-data](https://www.ourcommons.ca/en/open-data)
* Provides: Members of Parliament (MPs), bills, votes, committees, etc.
* Format: XML & CSV primarily (not always REST/JSON).

#### **2. LEGISinfo API**

* ✅ Exists (sort of): [https://www.parl.ca/LEGISinfo](https://www.parl.ca/LEGISinfo)
* Provides: Bill tracking and legislative summaries.
* Format: No public REST API, but scrape-friendly and some structured feeds.

#### **3. CanLII API (Canadian Legal Information Institute)**

* ✅ Exists (via partner access): [https://www.canlii.org/en/info/api.html](https://www.canlii.org/en/info/api.html)
* Provides: Legal case law, statutes, and regulations.
* Requires: Partnership or formal approval.

#### **4. Statistics Canada API**

* ✅ Exists: [https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/developers](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/developers)
* Format: RESTful JSON with powerful dataset query tools.

#### **5. Open Government Canada APIs**

* ✅ Exists: [https://open.canada.ca/en/developer](https://open.canada.ca/en/developer)
* Includes data on: spending, environment, health, transport, etc.

#### **6. Elections Canada (Partial)**

* 🟡 Partial: [https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res\&dir=api\&document=index\&lang=e](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=api&document=index&lang=e)
* Public APIs are **limited to geography & maps** (electoral districts).
* No public voter data, results, or turnout via API.

---

### 🟡 **Partially Existing or Scrape-Only APIs**

#### **1. House of Commons Committee Data**

* 🟡 Exists in static form via [Open Parliament](https://openparliament.ca) or scraping official sites.
* Not officially REST API-exposed.

#### **2. Provincial Legislature APIs (Ontario, Quebec, BC, etc.)**

* 🟡 Vary by province.
* Ontario: Limited structured data via [OLA Open Data](https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/open-data)
* Quebec: [https://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/index.html](https://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/index.html) — scrapeable, not an API
* BC: No official API. Manual scraping needed.

### ❌ **APIs That Don’t Publicly Exist (As Described):**

#### **1. Supreme Court of Canada API**

* ❌ No public API.
* Data is only available via the [SCC Judgments site](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/en/nav.do), which must be scraped.

#### **2. Department of Justice API**

* ❌ No general REST API for federal statutes or regulation updates.
* Data is available in HTML/PDF formats only.

#### **3. CBC, CTV, Canadian Press, Globe and Mail APIs**

* ❌ No public APIs.
* These are media companies with **proprietary paywalled content**.
* Any API access requires **licensing agreements** or scraping behind legal risk walls.

---

### 🟡 **Authentication & Civic Identity APIs**

#### **GCKey / Government Authentication**

* 🟡 GCKey exists as a service, **but is not an open public API**. You need **formal partnership** to integrate with GCKey or use it for third-party login.

#### **Provincial ID Verification APIs**

* ❌ No open APIs. Identity services are heavily restricted to **authorized institutions only** (banks, government apps).

### 🔧 Recommendations (Execution Order):

1. **Integrate Parliament of Canada Open Data + StatCan first.** These are stable, structured, and rich.
2. **Use CanLII for legal data** (request access if needed).
3. **Scrape LEGISinfo and provincial legislatures** as interim pipelines until official feeds are exposed.
4. **Do not build media-based features assuming API access** — instead, train AI on scraped content (watch for copyright).
5. **Use Open Canada’s APIs** to enrich data graphs (budgets, census, health).
6. **Leave GCKey and ID integration until you’re in production with a government partner.**

Let me know which ones you want help querying, documenting, or integrating into your pipeline. I can auto-generate fetch functions, database schemas, or scrapers depending on which tier you're building out.
