II. üîÑ Module Interdependencies and Live Interactions
Every module is symbiotic with 2‚Äì5 others. CivicOS is a full-system lattice. Here‚Äôs how the data flows:

FROM ‚Üí	TO	FUNCTION
Politician Profiles	Contact Directory, Memory Engine, Party Strength	Connect identity with behavior, voting, lobbying
Voting Records	Voting Sim, Party Strength, Memory Engine	Fuel simulations, detect loyalty drift
News Deconstructor	Narrative Protocols, Civic Pulse, Forum Enrichment	AI counter-spin, thread context
Bill Tracker	Petition Engine, Voting Sim, Policy Sandbox	Create petitions, simulate outcomes
Campaign Finance	Lobbying, Corruption Pattern	Match money to behavior
Lobbyist Tool	Bill Tracker, Voting Records	Match lobbying with votes and outcomes
Procurement Layer	Corruption Pattern, Civic Pulse	Detect vendor favoritism
Case Tracker	Charter Index, Legal Repo	Legal risk radar
Forum Engine	Civic Pulse, News Feed, Issue Ranking	Surface high-signal public discourse
AI Command	All modules	Answering, parsing, narrative breakdown
Civic Intelligence Feed	All modules	Aggregate user actions into system behavior map
Civic Reputation System (future)	Forum + Petitions + Voting Sim	Reward real engagement

III. üß† AI Layer Logic (Claude + GPT Chain of Thought)
Dual Redundancy: Claude executes deep political logic and parsing; GPT handles legal formalism and NLP classification.

Cross-Validation: Two models answer in parallel; CivicOS compares for contradiction or hallucination.

Inference Paths:

‚ÄúSummarize this bill‚Äù ‚Üí Bill Tracker ‚Üí Claude + GPT ‚Üí Natural Query

‚ÄúWhat happened to that MP‚Äôs position on X?‚Äù ‚Üí Politician + News + Voting ‚Üí Memory Engine ‚Üí Narrative Protocol

‚ÄúHas this lobbying group affected policy?‚Äù ‚Üí Lobbyist + Voting + Contracts ‚Üí Corruption Generator ‚Üí Civic Pulse
