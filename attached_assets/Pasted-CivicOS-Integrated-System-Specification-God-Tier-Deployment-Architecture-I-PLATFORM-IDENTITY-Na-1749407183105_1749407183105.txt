Source Fidelity Doctrine: Only official institutional or verified third-party endpoints used.

Zero Simulation Rule: No placeholders, test data, or hypothetical reps.

User Sovereignty Principle: System adapts to user’s civic map, not the reverse.

Transparency over Neutrality: Biases are surfaced, not erased.

IX. FINAL INTEGRATION SUMMARY

Every CivicOS subsystem feeds into a real-time core pipeline governed by AI mediation, cross-referencing logic, and scheduled update batches.

Subsystem interdependencies:

Petition Engine ↔ Issue Grid: Surface petitions on hot issues

Forum ↔ Bill Tracker ↔ Politician Votes: Link debates to legislation + rep decisions

Campaign Finance ↔ Voting Patterns: Map donor influence to vote outcomes

News Deconstructor ↔ Trust Oscillator: Track public trust in correlation with narratives

Simulation Stack ↔ Legal Oversight: Stress-test civic models against legal precedent

FOI + Whistleblower ↔ Corruption Pattern Generator: Auto-triangulate risk maps

All are tied to a unified Civic AI Core, allowing real-time civic feedback, system alerts, and predictive analytics. CivicOS thus functions as a sovereign, recursive, and self-adaptive infrastructure layer over Canada's democratic apparatus.
