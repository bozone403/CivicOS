# üîí CivicOS Supabase Security Implementation Guide

## üîê Security Policies Implemented

### 1. Public Read Access (Government Data)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON public.politicians
    FOR SELECT USING (true);
```
**Applies to**: All government data tables
**Purpose**: Allow public access to government information for transparency

### 2. User-Specific Access (Personal Data)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON public.users
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid()::text = id);
```
**Applies to**: User profiles, notifications, messages, activity
**Purpose**: Users can only access their own personal data

### 3. User-Generated Content (Public Read, Authenticated Write)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON public.social_posts
    FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create posts" ON public.social_posts
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own posts" ON public.social_posts
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id);
```
**Applies to**: Social posts, comments, votes, likes
**Purpose**: Public can read content, authenticated users can create/update their own

### 4. Voting System (Public Read, Authenticated Write)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON public.votes
    FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create votes" ON public.votes
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = user_id);
```
**Applies to**: Votes, electoral votes, petition signatures
**Purpose**: Public can see voting results, users can only create their own votes

## üöÄ How to Apply the Migration

### Option 1: Using the Script
```bash
# Set your Supabase database URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"

# Run the migration script
./apply-rls-migration.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Application
```bash
# Connect to your Supabase database
psql "postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"

# Apply the migration
\i migrations/0008_enable_rls_security.sql
```

### Option 3: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `migrations/0008_enable_rls_security.sql`
4. Execute the migration

## ‚úÖ Verification

After applying the migration, verify that:

1. **All tables have RLS enabled**:
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY tablename;
```

2. **Policies are created**:
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

3. **Supabase linter warnings are resolved**:
- Check your Supabase project dashboard
- All "RLS Disabled in Public" warnings should be gone

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Tables
When adding new tables, ensure RLS is enabled:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on new table
ALTER TABLE public.new_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Add appropriate policies
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON public.new_table
    FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

### Modifying Policies
To modify existing policies:

```sql
-- Drop existing policy
DROP POLICY "Policy Name" ON public.table_name;

-- Create new policy
CREATE POLICY "New Policy Name" ON public.table_name
    FOR SELECT USING (your_condition);
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Benefits

1. **Data Protection**: Users can only access their own personal data
2. **Public Transparency**: Government data remains publicly accessible
3. **Content Integrity**: Users can only modify their own content
4. **Voting Security**: Users can only create their own votes
5. **Compliance**: Meets Supabase security requirements

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Authentication Required**: Some features now require user authentication
2. **API Changes**: Backend APIs may need updates to handle RLS
3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test all features after applying RLS
4. **Backup**: Always backup your database before applying migrations

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Supabase logs for policy violations
2. Verify authentication is working correctly
3. Test with authenticated and unauthenticated users
4. Review the specific policy that's causing issues

## üîÑ Rollback

If you need to rollback the RLS implementation:

```sql
-- Disable RLS on all tables (NOT RECOMMENDED for production)
ALTER TABLE public.users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- Repeat for all tables
```

**Warning**: Rolling back RLS removes security protections. Only do this in development.
