## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- [ ] Update `DATABASE_URL` with your Supabase connection string
- [ ] Set a strong `SESSION_SECRET` for JWT signing
- [ ] Update `CORS_ORIGIN` to your domain
- [ ] Add your Supabase URL and anon key
- [ ] Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your domain

### Step 2: Upload to Hostinger
- [ ] Access Hostinger File Manager
- [ ] Navigate to your domain's root directory
- [ ] Upload all files from `hostinger-deploy/`
- [ ] Ensure `.env` file is in the root directory
- [ ] Set proper file permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)

### Step 3: Configure Hostinger
- [ ] Contact Hostinger support about Node.js app
- [ ] Request port 5000 access
- [ ] Provide entry point: `dist/server/index.js`
- [ ] Request startup script execution: `./start.sh`

### Step 4: Test Deployment
- [ ] Visit your domain homepage
- [ ] Test API health endpoint: `/api/health`
- [ ] Test authentication (login/register)
- [ ] Check for CORS errors in browser console
- [ ] Verify database connections

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Checklist

### If Frontend Doesn't Load
- [ ] Check if `public/index.html` exists
- [ ] Verify `.htaccess` routing rules

- [ ] Ensure all assets are uploaded

### If API Doesn't Work
- [ ] Verify Node.js is running on port 5000
- [ ] Check environment variables are loaded
- [ ] Test database connection
- [ ] Review application logs

### If Database Connection Fails
- [ ] Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
- [ ] Check Supabase connection settings
- [ ] Ensure Hostinger IP is allowed in Supabase
- [ ] Test connection manually

## 📁 File Structure Verification

Your Hostinger root should contain:
```
public_html/
├── dist/
│   ├── server/          # Backend code
│   └── shared/          # Shared schemas
├── public/              # Frontend files
│   ├── assets/          # Built assets
│   └── index.html       # Main HTML file
├── package.json         # Dependencies
├── package-lock.json    # Lock file
├── .env                 # Environment variables
├── start.sh            # Startup script
└── .htaccess           # Apache config
```

## 🔒 Security Verification

- [ ] HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] JWT secret is strong and unique
