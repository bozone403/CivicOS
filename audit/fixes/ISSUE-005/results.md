## ISSUE-005 Results — CORS header for civicos.ca on /health

Symptom: Missing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` for `Origin: https://civicos.ca` on `/health` (live). Verified by `scripts/verify-deployment.sh` and failing E2E.

Pre-fix evidence:
- E2E pre-fix: `audit/fixes/ISSUE-005/e2e-pre-fix.log` (timeout; live did not respond with expected header)

Fix implemented:
- Ensure CORS headers on `/health` by inserting a dedicated middleware before the route to set ACAO for allowed origins and handle `OPTIONS`.
- File: `server/index.ts` (added `app.use('/health', ...)` block before `app.get('/health', ...)`).

Build status:
- Server build: `audit/fixes/ISSUE-005/build-server.log` — OK
- Client build: `audit/fixes/ISSUE-005/build-client.log` — OK

Post-fix test (live):
- E2E post-fix: `audit/fixes/ISSUE-005/e2e-post-fix.log` — still failing because live Render has not been deployed yet.

Status: FIXED LOCALLY — awaiting deployment to Render.

Acceptance Criteria:
- After deployment, `scripts/verify-deployment.sh` CORS probe shows `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://civicos.ca` for `/health`.
- E2E `tests/e2e/issue-005.spec.ts` passes.

Deploy notes:
- Deploy via existing Render pipeline. No env changes required; relies on `CORS_ORIGIN`/`FRONTEND_BASE_URL` and civicos.ca defaults.
